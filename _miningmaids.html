                <p>Being apart of crypto mining at the time we needed some more dedicated miners at the time
                </p>
                <p>The main problem was that there was not enough information out at the time and we needed to experiement if each motherboard would be able to handle and let us use more than 3 or more graphics cards in one unit. </p>
                <p>our first motherboard blew and burned the 24 pin atx female connector on the motherboard and also burned the psu side of the 6+2 PCIE female connector (Sorry I only had a photo of the PSU(Powersupply))</p>

                </p>
                <p>We found the solution to the Mobo(Motherboard) exploding problem for the Powersupply it was caused by overvolting and error </p>
                <p>The second motherboard was a semi success now the problem with this computer was that, not all the GPUs were getting detected which caused us problem since we needed all the gpus to work</p>
                <p>in order to have for all the gpu's to work we first tried to install the graphics drivers. we then would restart the whole system consistenly (total around 30 times)</p>
                <p>And somehow after all the restarting the system started to detect the GPUs which solved our problem to get more than 3 gpus on one system</p>

                <p>Thank you for your time on reading on this project of mine (Sorry since I did build this a very long time ago when I first started mining at 2014 (It is currently 2019) I don't have much information about this anymore sadly )</p>
