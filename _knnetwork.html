                <p>KN Network is a network for server hosting based in Australia.</p>
                <br>Having to go through high ping servers to have a fun game of minecraft or iW4x really irritated me.
                <br>My first thought was "Why not make my own server network"
                <br>Using Windows Server as my os (GUI), my rack mount servers with 128gbs of ram each server and my domain, I brought off <a href="namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a>
                <br>I Was ready to setup my servers!
                <br>For the Website I used <b>apache</b> and for my game servers I had server one host the games with their dedicated server files. Server two was being used as a private media server but can still be accessed from the public
                <p><a href="jellyfin.knnetwork.xyz">jellyfin.knnetwork.xyz</a></p>
                <br>Anyways I had to reverse proxy the media server so i could host it on the site
                <br>and that was it! my servers were up.

                <p>You can check the site out here
