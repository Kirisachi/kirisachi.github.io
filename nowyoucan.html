                    Testing of a mobile/browser application in its Alpha/Beta stage. The system both App (Android/iPhone) and Browser platform was designed to provide efficient incident reporting between tenants and facility managers in order to have fast responses and track
                    facility incidents for management.

                    With NowYouCan. I had a option to login with and without a <b>QR code</b> that was supplied around the building I dediced to do the <b>Non-QR</b> User Journey
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>Now you can't</b> (Do you get it because the project is named NowYouCan hahahaha......) just start testing the product with no plan or strategy
                <br>So I made a strategy model in <b>xMind</b> But just before I made the mindmap, I decided to have a meeting with the founder of <b>NowYouCan.io</b></br>
                <br>
                <center><b>Here it is Below \/\/\/ </b>(Just Right click and open in a new window to make it readable)</center>

                    Now the claims you see in my little mind map above ^ . Well I interviewed some of the people who actually used the app to check if these claims were true or not. Well the red flags = It wasn't true. Yep all the claims were not true
                </p>

                    <center>Now here is the bug spreadsheet ^^</center>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now thats quite a bit of bugs just for the web right?, that wasn't the only thing we found. There was a security flaw as well on the website. and consistent crashing on android and of course we reported all of these bugs to him
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Now im feeling a bit bad for the developers for this list)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways that was it for this project. I don't want to get to into details to save his tail because I believe if he gets these things fixed and reorganise a few things NowYouCan will work.
